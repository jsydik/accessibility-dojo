If there is any conflict, those policies, procedures, and processes should lead your practice.</p><p>Next, I want you to understand that what’s happening to you right now <em>sucks</em>.  It’s <em>nonsense</em> and you are absolutely right if you feel angry about it. This reality is not the way to provide Good Instructional Design for Distance Learning and it’s unfair to expect it from you (and your students) without prior experience and at best days to prep.</p><p>Finally, to borrow the tagline of Douglas Adams’ fine old guide—<em>Don’t Panic</em>.  Things may or not be “okay”, but you’re doing your best. You’re here reading this in spite of the cards you’ve been dealt because, like most instructors I know, you care that much about your students and the things you are teaching them, so let’s see what we can do.</p><h2>Getting Your Bearings</h2><p>To scope your needs you will want to identify which students in your class have accommodations that you need to account for.  You will likely know who these students are and what their accommodations are from your in-classroom semester. For questions about how existing in-class accommodations need to be implemented or modified during transition, the most important thing you can do is to contact your campus student services or ADA offices—you absolutely will not be the first person to ask them.</p><p>The goal here is to know which resources you will and won’t need.  For example, if you don’t have anyone in the current term with a text or visual disability, but you do have someone who is deaf or hard of hearing, you will likely be able to put your checks for alternate text on the back burner, but captions or transcripts will be a pressing need and, depending on your institution’s CART captiomer or interpreter availability, there may be restrictions on when or how long you will be able to run synchronous sessions.</p><p>The prominent feature of triage is that we’re not going to address every accessibility concern <em>right now</em>.  We’re going to identify what <em>needs</em> to be done <em>right now</em> and address those to keep the ship afloat. I can hear a few of my professional colleagues tensing up right now, so I need to make it absolutely clear—this approach can <strong><em>ONLY</em></strong> be taken for online courses and resources that are only available to the instructor and the current semester’s students.  If you are producing resources for public distribution, they need to be fully accessible in all ways. Given the current reality, my recommendation is to keep your materials locked down at this point and focus on the students you have <em>this</em> semester, After this term and the current crisis is over, you may well wish to get back to classroom-only teaching or you may choose to keep some of these resources available for the long term.  <em>then</em> you can revisit them and fill the remaining gaps needed to make them a reusable resource.</p><p>Additionally, you’ll want to check in with all your students if you haven’t already.  They’re facing many of the same sorts of disruptions you are—thrust into an online class that was supposed to be in-person to deal with classroom technologies they’re not familiar with.  Some of them will also be doing it with kids who are now at home with them while their own schools are moving online. They may also be anxious with uncertainties related to their own job changes and/or losses or even of an unexpected move across the city, state, or country.  All of these factors will have their own implications for which technologies you’ll want to use to teach—if large numbers of students are unable to connect at what had been the usual class time, and even if you all chose the in-person classroom for the benefits of synchronous interaction, asynchronous discussion may not only be your only option, it may be the best one for these circumstances.</p><h2>Disabilities and Classroom Technology</h2><p>Formally, when we talk about disability, we’re meaning a physical or mental impairment to an individual that substantially limits one or more major life activities.  There are many broad categories of disabilities, but for the purposes of digital content, the bulk of your efforts will be focused on visual, auditory, mobility, and cognitive disabilities.</p><h3>Visual Disabilities</h3><p>Persons who are blind or have low vision will use screen reader or screen magnification software to access and navigate online content.  Two key techniques for accessibility for this group of people will be to make sure any web forms that you create have clear labeling, and to write alternate text for any images and charts you make available.  This text should be focused on <em>your intent</em> as an instructor—don’t get trapped into describing details of the image that weren’t part of why you selected it.</p><p>Other people may have average visual acuity but have color blindness or another condition that reduces the ability to distinguish hue or contrast.  While some adjustments can be made from their end, the proper practice is to check images and color selections before using them. Color and contrast can be tested using tools like <a href="https://asada.website/cvsimulator/e/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chromatic Vision Simulator</a> or <a href="https://developer.paciellogroup.com/resources/contrastanalyser/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colour Contrast Analyser</a>.</p><p>Finally, while it’s not truly a visual issue per se, repetitive content that causes flash or flicker is tremendously dangerous to persons susceptible to photosensitive seizures.  This is a more advanced topic, but suffice it to say, if you find that your videos or other content have a strobe-like effect, don’t use them and seek assistance.</p><h3>Auditory Disabilities</h3><p>For classroom purposes, addressing the needs of persons who are deaf or hard of hearing is technically simpler yet more labor intensive comparatively.  Your podcasts or other audio content will require transcripts, your video will require captions, and your live conferencing will need a captioner or sign  interpreter. For all of these, you will want to contact your student services for guidance and availability of resources.</p><p>It is important to note that automatic transcription and captioning tools are useful if you don’t have external resources available, but the results are <em>not</em> sufficient and require editing to be accessible.  That said, if you don’t have access or funding for contracted options like <a href="https://www.3playmedia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3Play</a>, <a href="http://www.rev.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rev</a>, or <a href="http://verbit.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Verbit</a>, starting with automatic captions in YouTube or a transcript from <a href="http://otter.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Otter.ai</a> can speed the process tremendously.</p><h3>Mobility Disabilities</h3><p>For the online classroom, the key things to remember for persons with mobility disabilities will be that they may not be able to use a mouse pointer based interface (or in some cases may require one).  While this will hopefully be handled by your LMS/CMS, it never hurts to try tabbing through any interactive content you create to ensure that it can work mouse-free. It’ll also mean avoiding small or closely spaced images or buttons that would need to be clicked on for those who use eye tracking or have a tremor that makes mouse use possible but difficult.</p><h3>Cognitive and Psychological Disabilities</h3><p>Your students may have a wide variety of cognitive or psychological disabilities that influence how they will interact with your course content, but many of the techniques you’ll need to be aware of are things that you will already know from your in-person classroom experience such as constructing slides and graphics to be clearly perceivable, selecting fonts less likely to interfere with a processing disorder, and so on.  For asynchronous content, you won’t have the opportunity for immediate feedback if your content isn’t clearly understood, so it is important to keep your language clear and straightforward. For synchronized meetings, on the other hand, you will be interacting in real time but still won’t have access to body and facial language or other classroom cues you may be used to, so it may be helpful to be particularly intentional about checking in with your students frequently to verify understanding.</p><p>Outside of these, for the purposes of online instruction, the most likely accommodations you’re likely to encounter is flexibility with attendance or assignment due dates, which will be mostly procedural rather than technical (though you should make sure that you’re familiar with how to adjust a due date in your LMS and determine how the student will be able to get access to missed material in this new environment).</p><p>So, that’s it?  Well, No. Not at all. But it’s a start.  I’ll be trying to write and update content that explores these issues in more depth in the near future.</p><h2>Act on It!</h2><ol><li>Communicate with students and disability services as needed to understand their needs and your own.</li><li>Contact your campus learning or information technologies group to request access to accessibility guides for online classroom technologies that you plan to use (LMS/CMS, video conferencing, chat, forums, etc).</li><li>Beginning with the course content coming up first, begin to build a plan of attack, starting with the absolute minimum that it takes to get the students what you need them to have and building from there.</li><li>Practice self care.  This is a marathon, not a sprint, and you’re the leader of your classroom community.  Keeping yourself well is a high priority as well.</li></ol></div><div class="post__aside"><div class="post__share"></div></div><div class="post__footer"><div class="post__bio box"><div><h2 class="h6"><a href="https://jsydik.github.io/accessibility-dojo/authors/jeremy-sydik/" title="Jeremy Sydik">Jeremy Sydik</a></h2></div></div><div class="post__nav box"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a href="https://jsydik.github.io/accessibility-dojo/principles-before-guidelines.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="prev"><img class="lazyload" data-src="https://jsydik.github.io/accessibility-dojo/media/posts/3/responsive/JusticeNYC-xs.jpg" data-srcset="https://jsydik.github.io/accessibility-dojo/media/posts/3/responsive/JusticeNYC-xs.jpg" data-expand="300" alt="Sculpture of Jusice from the New York City Court"><div class="u-small">Previous Post Principles Before Guidelines</div></a></div></div></div></article></main><aside class="sidebar"><section class="box featured"><h3 class="box__title">Featured</h3><ul class="featured__container"><li class="featured__item"><a href="https://jsydik.github.io/accessibility-dojo/knowing_where_ones_towel_is.html" class="featured__image-link"><img class="lazyload" src="https://jsydik.github.io/accessibility-dojo/media/posts/4/responsive/EmptyClassroom-xs.jpg" data-srcset="https://jsydik.github.io/accessibility-dojo/media/posts/4/responsive/EmptyClassroom-xs.jpg" alt="Chairs and desks in an empty classroom"></a><div><a href="https://jsydik.github.io/accessibility-dojo/knowing_where_ones_towel_is.html" class="featured__title">Knowing Where One&#x27;s Towel Is</a> <time class="u-small" datetime="2020-03-18T04:04">2020 March 18th</time></div></li><li class="featured__item"><a href="https://jsydik.github.io/accessibility-dojo/principles-before-guidelines.html" class="featured__image-link"><img class="lazyload" src="https://jsydik.github.io/accessibility-dojo/media/posts/3/responsive/JusticeNYC-xs.jpg" data-srcset="https://jsydik.github.io/accessibility-dojo/media/posts/3/responsive/JusticeNYC-xs.jpg" alt="Sculpture of Jusice from the New York City Court"></a><div><a href="https://jsydik.github.io/accessibility-dojo/principles-before-guidelines.html" class="featured__title">Principles Before Guidelines</a> <time class="u-small" datetime="2020-01-06T08:09">2020 January 6th</time></div></li><li class="featured__item"><a href="https://jsydik.github.io/accessibility-dojo/once_upon_a_time.html" class="featured__image-link"><img class="lazyload" src="https://jsydik.github.io/accessibility-dojo/media/posts/2/responsive/Bulldozer-Vetsikas-BW-xs.jpg" data-srcset="https://jsydik.github.io/accessibility-dojo/media/posts/2/responsive/Bulldozer-Vetsikas-BW-xs.jpg" alt="An old bulldozer"></a><div><a href="https://jsydik.github.io/accessibility-dojo/once_upon_a_time.html" class="featured__title">Once Upon a Time</a> <time class="u-small" datetime="2020-01-01T00:00">2020 January 1st</time></div></li></ul></section></aside><footer class="footer"><a class="footer__logo" href="https://jsydik.github.io/accessibility-dojo/"><img src="https://jsydik.github.io/accessibility-dojo/media/website/BannerBW.png" alt="A11y Dojo"></a><nav><ul class="footer__nav"></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright"><p class="align-left">Accessibilty Dojo © 2020 Jeremy Sydik. </p><p class="align-left">Opinions given are solely of the author; no warranty should be implied for the accuracy, currentness, or utility of the information contained within; and no endorsement should be implied by the mention of external products or content.</p></div></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {

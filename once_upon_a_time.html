The keyboard was one of the newer (at the time) ergonomic keyboards, which the user had never worked with.  The speakers were an even bigger problem.  They came out of the box set to a low volume and I hadn’t thought to set them high so they could be controlled from software.  The user began to panic when the interface to the system was completely disrupted.  Two decisions that wouldn’t have usually been a problem turned the afternoon into a disaster.</p><p>Of course, the real problem was human, not technological.  My mistake was in my assumption about how people use computers which, of course, was how I used a computer.  I knew that blind users needed to use special software on their computers, but I didn’t consider the real difference in user experience.  Later that evening, I got curious about my web sites—seeing how much difference something as simple as a different keyboard could make, how would my sites behave for users with screen readers instead of monitors and keyboards but not mice?</p><p>It wasn’t pretty.  I knew that I needed to design my sites differently, but what exactly did I need to do?  It turns out that accessibility isn’t really that much about what you do—it’s a matter of how you do it.  What I really needed was information on what being accessible means and how to think from the perspectives of many kinds of users.</p></blockquote><p>So that's what happened. I went to my HCI professor and started asking questions. At the time, HCI (now usually considered UX) wasn't a prominent topic in many computer science programs, so she advised that I go speak with some cognitive psychologists. As luck would have it, the ADA officer who ran the lab I was working in, Dr. Christy Horn, was a leading advocate for the rights of persons with disabilities as well as professor of educational psychology. She was also a persistent recruiter of graduate students—which resulted (eventually) in my own pursuit of a doctorate.</p><p>John Lennon said it well—"Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans."  The book was finished shortly before I completed my master's work, Christy and I continued to work on grants to improve higher education for students with disabilities, I eventually took over operations of the lab I started in, and my spouse and I added two more children to our lives.  Things were good but certainly busy.</p><p>One day, a couple of years back, I got the note that all technical authors do that the run for Design Accessible Web Sites was finished and it would be going out of print.  It was around much longer than I expected, actually—better than half a decade if a great run for an edition.  Remarkably, the vast majority of the content is still relevant—there are certainly things that have become dated.  For example, I could now write the chapter on Flash in one word—"Don't."  The real question was how to get this content back out there where it could be useful to others.</p><p>I punted around the idea of revising a new edition, but held off.  I was finishing up my dissertation, raising my kids is always my chief priority, and then professional changes made life excessively busy for a couple of years.  More importantly, I noticed a pattern—every couple of years, a new accessibility author would put out a book, it would make its run, and then disappear into the twilight.  While I'm still very proud of the product, I'm not entirely sure that books are the best way to approach this kind of content.  Even at the time, I wrote the book a series of articles designed to be read out of order as needed in the process of professional practice.   </p><p>So the answer is this - a return to blog style articles for the first time in a long while.  My plan is to revisit old content from Design Accessible Web Sites, splitting, updating, and remixing as needed as well as to periodically write up new things as they become timely.  At this point there is no particular schedule or timeline, so bear with me.</p><p>As an aside, Design Accessible Web Sites began "It was a dark and stormy night..." (really).  My editor was <em>not at all</em> happy with this choice, but it got enough of a positive result from readers that I'll kick off this set of articles with "Once upon a time" anyway.    </p></div><div class="post__aside"><div class="post__share"></div></div><div class="post__footer"><div class="post__bio box"><div><h2 class="h6"><a href="https://jsydik.github.io/accessibility-dojo/authors/jeremy-sydik/" title="Jeremy Sydik">Jeremy Sydik</a></h2></div></div><div class="post__nav box"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a href="https://jsydik.github.io/accessibility-dojo/its-not-polite-to-flash-your-audience.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="prev"><img class="lazyload" data-src="https://jsydik.github.io/accessibility-dojo/media/posts/1/responsive/Bulldozer-Vetsikas-BW-xs.jpg" data-srcset="https://jsydik.github.io/accessibility-dojo/media/posts/1/responsive/Bulldozer-Vetsikas-BW-xs.jpg" data-expand="300" alt="An old bulldozer, photographed in black and white"><div class="u-small">Previous Post It&#x27;s Not Polite to Flash Your Audience</div></a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><a href="https://jsydik.github.io/accessibility-dojo/principles-before-guidelines.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="u-small">Next Post Principles Before Guidelines</div><img class="lazyload" data-src="https://jsydik.github.io/accessibility-dojo/media/posts/3/responsive/EmptyClassroom-xs.jpg" data-srcset="https://jsydik.github.io/accessibility-dojo/media/posts/3/responsive/EmptyClassroom-xs.jpg" data-expand="300" alt="Desks and Chairs in an Empty Classroom"></a></div></div></div></article></main><aside class="sidebar"><section class="box featured"><h3 class="box__title">Featured</h3><ul class="featured__container"><li class="featured__item"><a href="https://jsydik.github.io/accessibility-dojo/knowing_where_ones_towel_is.html" class="featured__image-link"><img class="lazyload" src="https://jsydik.github.io/accessibility-dojo/media/posts/4/responsive/AccessMazeBW-xs.jpg" data-srcset="https://jsydik.github.io/accessibility-dojo/media/posts/4/responsive/AccessMazeBW-xs.jpg" alt=""></a><div><a href="https://jsydik.github.io/accessibility-dojo/knowing_where_ones_towel_is.html" class="featured__title">Knowing Where One&#x27;s Towel Is</a> <time class="u-small" datetime="2020-03-18T18:00">2020 March 18th</time></div></li><li class="featured__item"><a href="https://jsydik.github.io/accessibility-dojo/principles-before-guidelines.html" class="featured__image-link"><img class="lazyload" src="https://jsydik.github.io/accessibility-dojo/media/posts/3/responsive/EmptyClassroom-xs.jpg" data-srcset="https://jsydik.github.io/accessibility-dojo/media/posts/3/responsive/EmptyClassroom-xs.jpg" alt="Desks and Chairs in an Empty Classroom"></a><div><a href="https://jsydik.github.io/accessibility-dojo/principles-before-guidelines.html" class="featured__title">Principles Before Guidelines</a> <time class="u-small" datetime="2020-01-06T08:09">2020 January 6th</time></div></li><li class="featured__item"><a href="https://jsydik.github.io/accessibility-dojo/once_upon_a_time.html" class="featured__image-link"><img class="lazyload" src="https://jsydik.github.io/accessibility-dojo/media/posts/2/responsive/JusticeNYC-xs.jpg" data-srcset="https://jsydik.github.io/accessibility-dojo/media/posts/2/responsive/JusticeNYC-xs.jpg" alt="Sculpture of Justice at New York City Courthouse"></a><div><a href="https://jsydik.github.io/accessibility-dojo/once_upon_a_time.html" class="featured__title">Once Upon a Time</a> <time class="u-small" datetime="2020-01-01T00:00">2020 January 1st</time></div></li></ul></section></aside><footer class="footer"><a class="footer__logo" href="https://jsydik.github.io/accessibility-dojo/"><img src="https://jsydik.github.io/accessibility-dojo/media/website/BannerBW.png" alt="A11y Dojo"></a><nav><ul class="footer__nav"></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright"><p class="align-left">Accessibilty Dojo © 2020 Jeremy Sydik. </p><p class="align-left">Opinions given are solely of the author; no warranty should be implied for the accuracy, currentness, or utility of the information contained within; and no endorsement should be implied by the mention of external products or content.</p></div></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {

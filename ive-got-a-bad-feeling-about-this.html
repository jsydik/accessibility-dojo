               <p>I'm seeing and hearing a lot of comments and shared stories about feeling "buzzy" or "staticky" or alternatively "cloudy" or "muffled". What's being described are kinds of hypervigilance and dissociation - they're ways that our brains are trying to keep us well by managing anxiety and trauma (and yes - what's happening right now even to those of us who are in the safest positions IS anxiety inducing and traumatic).</p>
<p>The hypervigilance is that "always-on" feeling that says "There's a threat out there right now that I need to be alert and ready for" and raises our levels to keep us ready to respond. The dissociation is a "layer of glass" feeling that says "I'm feeling this Way too loudly and often to do this for long" and distances us as protection. By themselves, these are perfectly useful emotional tools that take care of us just fine—we become super-aware for a time when we see the ball bounce into the street in front of our car or go to our "relaxed place" during a blood draw when the needle shows up— and then we go have a cup of tea or work out or meet up with a friend, or just get on with our day and natural coping dissipates.</p>
<p>Except right now, that isn't happening. The threat out there is large and hard to manage or control and not going away soon and it's bringing related stressors and traumas alongside it. Our normal routines are upended, our social circles interrupted or modified, and our access to places of security or safety limited. To top of it, many of us who have never had to work through anxieties or traumas that have overcome their coping don't have a backup list of soothing or coping activities and strategies to rely on or experience seeking them out and are having to build them rapidly.</p>
<p>This is the part where I remind you that I'm one of those "other" kinds of psychologists and you should remember that these are my experiences and opinions and should not be taken as clinical advice. The four places to start that I think are most valuable are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find ways to distinguish your working and non-working time as best you can. Even if you can't separate spaces, transition them - close or minimize your work windows and put the physical objects aside.</li>
<li>Explore mindfulness or meditation. In particular, seriously reflect on (a) what is and is not important to you, (b) what is and is not necessary, and most importantly (c) what you do and do not have control of.</li>
<li>Find time for activity. Being active is a major part of keeping your neurochemistry functioning well. Options have changed a lot in our current context, but anything you can find enjoyment in gets you moving will help.</li>
<li>Find time to create and learn. This is <em>NOT</em> the nonsense advice about learning a new art or skill or creating a side gig. This is about keeping your mind active outside it's normal groove and seeking out the novelties that being out and about normally bring.</li>
</ul>
<p>And if these don't help and it gets worse—find a professional to talk to. Your mind and body are trying to make normal tools fit an abnormal reality and a good counselor has a lot of experience helping people create good tools for navigating that.</p>
